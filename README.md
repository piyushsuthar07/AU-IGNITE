# AU-IGNITE
Team project repository for developing, tracking, and maintaining all code and documentation.


## 📌 Quick Overview

- The **admin publishes tasks** (markdown files) in the `main` branch.
- Each member completes the task **in their personal branch only**.
- ❗ **No member is allowed to merge anything into main.**
- ❗ **Do not edit or push to another member’s branch.**

## 📄 Task Files (Naming Rules)

Tasks appear in main as Markdown files:
task1.md
task2.md
task3.md


The admin will announce which task to complete (e.g., *“Complete task2.md”*).

If starter code is required, it will be provided inside or alongside the task file.

## 📁 Repository Structure (Example)
main/ → Admin only (tasks like task1.md, task2.md)
└── task1.md
└── task2.md

piyush-suthar/ → Member branch
nishant-kumawat/
Pratik/
hema-negi/
Faijan/


Every member has **one dedicated branch**.  
Branches must remain separate — **no cross-branch modifications**.
